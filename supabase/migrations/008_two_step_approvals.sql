-- 008_two_step_approvals.sql — multi-admin governance (Phase 3).
--   * Every monetary approval requires 2 admins (or all admins, whichever is smaller).
--   * An admin cannot approve their own submission or loan.
--   * Not all admins may simultaneously hold active loans — at least one must
--     remain loan-free at any time.
--   * Tracking goes through dedicated approval tables so the audit trail of who
--     approved what is permanent and the PK prevents double-approval.
